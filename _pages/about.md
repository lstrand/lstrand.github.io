In March 2020, I have joined the Chair of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Real-time Systems at the TUM as a research assistant and a PhD candidate. I received my Master’s degree in Mechatronics and Information Technology from the TUM after finishing my Bachelor’s degree in Engineering Science at the TUM.

I have worked on the [Providentia++](https://innovation-mobility.com/projekt-providentia/) project with the goal of creating a real-time digital twin of the traffic on the Autobahn A9.

Currently, I am part of the [Videtec2](https://videtec-projekt.de) project working on 
integrating and evaluating vision and radar technology for detecting vulnerable road users at intersections. 

<!-- My research is focused on robust sensor data processing and multi-object tracking algorithms for distributed and real-time traffic localization using a multi-modal sensor infrastructure -->
My research has been directed towards ensuring the reliability and accuracy of multi-object tracking and localization using a multi-modal sensor infrastructure. 

Highlights
======

Check out my latest project on [vehicle pose and extent estimation](https://lstrand.github.io/joint-vehicle-pose-extent-estimation/) 
<!-- based on probabilistic state estimation.  -->

<!-- object tracking and localization based on probabilistic state estimation -->

<!-- In this context I have written a multi-object tracker in C++ using ROS, OpenCV, AI, ... -->
